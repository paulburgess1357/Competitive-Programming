# Competitive-Programming
The following is a collection of competitive programming notes and code.  The repo closely follows the chapter structure from the book *Guide to Competitive Programming 2nd Edition* by Antti Laaksonen.  However, the sources of the notes can come from a variety of places.  The primary source of the notes is listed at the top of each section.
